# Noise Report App – ENGR 408

This repository contains research, ideation, and early prototypes for the **Noise Report Mobile App**, a student project developed for the [Airport Cooperative Research Program (ACRP) University Design Challenge].

## ✈️ Project Summary
Residents living near airports often lack the tools to visualize and report aircraft noise in real time. Our app provides a clean interface for:
- Logging noise events
- Auto-tagging flights
- Visualizing weekly aircraft activity
- Receiving real-time alerts and stats

Developed as part of **ENGR 408 – Team 6**, Penn State (Summer 2025).

## 📄 Files
- Wireframes & mockups in `/assets`

## 🧪 Next Steps (Lead D)
- Build testable wireframes
- Begin Figma prototype
- Plan user feedback process

## 📚 References
